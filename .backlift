# add_remaining_scripts: (Yes or No) If Yes, all .js files in 
# the project will be packaged and linked to the main html 
# file. Files not included in the 'scripts' list will be 
# loaded in arbitrary order.

# If No, only the files listed in the scripts list will 
# be packaged and linked. Regardless, all script files will 
# be uploaded. You would only set 'add_remaining_scripts' to
# No if you were using a separate asset management library,
# like require.js
